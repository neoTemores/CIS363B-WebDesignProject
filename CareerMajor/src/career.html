            frameworks like React.
          </li>
          <li><span>Responsive design:</span> must understand the importance of dynamic websites so that the presentation is not negatively impacted by the user's device size.</li>

      </div>
      <p>
        <span>Expected growth:</span> According to the
        <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm#tab-6" target="_blank"> Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> the expected job growth
        for software developers is 26% over the next 10 years. This is considered a much faster than average job outlook.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Salary:</span> According to the
        <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm#tab-5" target="_blank"> Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>
        the average salary for a software engineer is $127,260 depending on experience and location.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Working conditions:</span> The job of a software engineer is usally a full time position, and requires sitting in front of a computer for extended periods of time,
        being indoors, attending meetings and working as part of a development team.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Major companies:</span> It would be nearly impossible to find a company in todays economy that does not have an online presense. So its fair to say that nearly every
        company in the world has a need for a software engineer. Ideally, I would like to work for a large company based in or near California so that I can be relatively clsoe to
        family.
