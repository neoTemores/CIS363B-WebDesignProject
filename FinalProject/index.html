    <p>Hello, my name is Neo Temores and I am currently a student at DeVry University. I am currently pursuing a
      Bachelor's of Science degree in <i>Software Development</i> with a concentration in <i>Web and Mobile Application
        Development</i>. After obtaining my degree, I intend to continue my education and work towards a Masters degree
      in Information Technology. This website was created as a part of my final course project for CIS363B: Web
      Interface Design. I completely enjoy learning about software develpment and writing code.
    </p>
    <p>A little bit about my background... I served in the U.S. Army for 4 years Active Duty as a 19D Cavalry Scout. I
      was station at Fort Hood, TX and was assigned to the 6th squadron, 9th cavalry regiment, 3rd armored brigade
      combat team, 1st cavalry division. As a part of my transition out of the military, I was given the opportunity
      to attend and successfuly completed a full stack web development bootcamp.
    </p>
    <p>My goal was to make this website as responsive as possible to provide an enjoyable user experience. This website
      was written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3. It was intentionally created completely by hand.
      I did not use any frameworks becuase I wanted to exercise and grow my foundational knowledge. Normally, I would
      have used React JS along with various modern libraries and extentions. This project was extremely fun to build and
      reinforced my passion for web development!
