    <h1>Welcome to my Digital Resume</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is Neo Temores and I am currently a student at DeVry University. I am currently pursuing a
      Bachelor's of Science degree in <i>Software Development</i> with a concentration in <i>Web and Mobile Application
        Development</i>. After obtaining my degree, I intend to continue my education and work towards a Masters degree
      in Information Technology. This website was created as a part of my final course project for CIS363B: Web
      Interface Design. I completely enjoy learning about software develpment and writing code.
    </p>
    <p>A little bit about my background... I served in the U.S. Army for 4 years Active Duty as a 19D Cavalry Scout. I
      was station at Fort Hood, TX and was assigned to the 6th squadron, 9th cavalry regiment, 3rd armored brigade
      combat team, 1st cavalry division. As a part of my transition out of the military, I was given to opportunity to
      attend and successfuly completed a full stack web development bootcamp.
    </p>
    <p>I am also happily married with 3 handsome little boys ranging in age from 4 months to 3 years old. Everything I
      do in life I do with 100% effort because of my family. I want to provide for them and give them a better life than
      I had. With that being said, I worked very hard on this project. My goal was to make this website as responsive as
      possible to provide an enjoyable user experience.
    </p>
    <p>This website was intentionally created completely by hand. It was written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.
      I did not use any frameworks becuase I wanted to exercise and grow my foundational knowledge. Normally, I would
      have used React JS along with various modern libraries and extentions. This project was extremely fun to build and
      reinforced my passion for web development!
